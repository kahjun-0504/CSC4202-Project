## **3.2 Cargo Value Modelling**

For single shipment orders, the truck proceeds directly to the destination. However, in cases involving multiple shipment orders, a **prioritization mechanism** is essential to determine which shipments should be selected and delivered first, especially when the truck’s weight capacity is limited.

To prioritize shipments effectively, each order is assigned a **priority score** that incorporates three key attributes: **revenue**, **urgency**, and **service level** (*premium* vs. *standard*). The score is calculated using the following formula:

priority_score = α⋅revenue + β⋅urgency + γ⋅service_level


Where:
- **revenue**: The amount earned by fulfilling the shipment.
- **urgency**: Calculated as `1 / time_remaining_in_days`, assigning higher scores to shipments with less time remaining.
- **service_level**: Set to **10** for premium service, and **0** for standard service, giving premium shipments significantly higher weight.
- **α, β, γ**: Weight parameters that can be adjusted based on business priorities, such as maximizing profit, ensuring timely delivery, or prioritizing premium customers. A larger **γ** ensures premium shipments are prioritized above all else when required.

Once the priority score is computed for each shipment, the values are used to guide the selection of shipments during the optimization process (e.g., using the **0/1 knapsack algorithm**). The algorithm evaluates all possible combinations of shipments and selects the set that maximizes the total priority score **without exceeding the truck’s weight capacity**, as defined by the 0/1 knapsack problem.

### **Default Weight Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                         | Value |
|----------:|-----------------------------------------------------|:------|
| α (alpha) | Importance of revenue                               | 0.5   |
| β (beta)  | Importance of urgency (based on days remaining)     | 0.3   |
| γ (gamma) | Importance of service level (Premium vs. Standard)  | 0.7   |

### **Shipment Selection Process**

1. **If the truck receives a single shipment order**, proceed with delivering that shipment directly to the destination.

2. **If multiple shipment orders are received** and their combined weight is within the truck’s capacity, load and deliver all shipments.

3. **If the total weight exceeds the truck’s capacity**, proceed as follows:
   - **Compute a priority score** for each shipment using the formula:  
     `priority_score = α⋅revenue + β⋅urgency + γ⋅service_level`
     - Urgency is calculated as `1 / time_remaining_in_days`, giving higher scores to more urgent deliveries.
     - Service level is set to **10** for premium shipments and **0** for standard shipments.

   - **Apply the 0/1 knapsack algorithm** to select the optimal combination of shipments:
     - Each shipment’s **value** is its **priority score**.
     - Each shipment’s **weight** is its actual **weight in kg**.
     - The algorithm chooses the combination that **maximizes the total priority score** without exceeding the truck’s weight limit.

4. **Deliver the selected shipments**. The order of delivery is flexible, as the prioritization has already been handled during the selection phase.

This structured approach ensures that **high-value, urgent, and premium shipments** are always prioritized when resources are limited, enhancing both **efficiency** and **customer satisfaction**.
