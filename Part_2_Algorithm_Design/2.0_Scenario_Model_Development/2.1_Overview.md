## 2.1 Overview
The optimized cargo loading algorithm focuses on efficiently selecting which shipments to load onto a truck when there are more shipments than the truck can carry. This becomes especially important when trucks face strict weight limits, and not all shipments can be delivered in a single trip.

The decision on which shipments to load is based on a priority score, which combines revenue, urgency, and service level (e.g., premium vs. standard). This ensures high-value and time-sensitive shipments are prioritized.

The scenario can be divided into two main components:
- Determine the priority score of each shipment based on business value.
- Select the combination of shipments that maximizes the total priority score without exceeding the truckâ€™s weight limit.
