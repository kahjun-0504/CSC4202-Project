## **5.3 Algorithm Descriptions**

This project uses the **0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming Algorithm** to select a subset of shipments that **maximizes a calculated priority score**, while ensuring the **total weight does not exceed the truck's capacity (500 kg)**.

### **Key Components**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Priority Score Calculation**

![Priority Score Calculation Formula](../../images/priority_score_calculation_formula.png)

This custom formula prioritizes:
- **Higher revenue**
- **More urgency** (shorter time remaining)
- **Premium service level**

---

#### **ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**

- `dp[i][w]` holds the **maximum score** using the first *i* shipments with weight limit *w*.
- `keep[i][w]` tracks whether shipment *i* is **included** in the optimal solution for backtracking.

---

#### **ðŸ”¹ Backtracking**

- Starts from `dp[n][W]` and traces which shipments were included.
- Shipment IDs are collected and **reversed** to get the original order.

---

### **Advantages of This Algorithm**

- âœ… Ensures **optimal selection** of shipments.
- âœ… **Efficient** for moderate input sizes.
- âœ… **Easy to extend** for additional constraints (e.g., time windows, volume).
