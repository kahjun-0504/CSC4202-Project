### 6.1.1 Problem Overview

In the **0/1 Knapsack problem**, we aim to choose a subset of items (in this case, **shipments**) with given weights and values (**priority scores**), to maximize the total value without exceeding a **weight capacity limit** (W = 500).

We use a **bottom-up dynamic programming (DP)** approach to fill a 2D array `dp[i][w]`, where:

- `i` is the number of shipments considered so far  
- `w` is the current weight capacity  
- `dp[i][w]` holds the maximum priority score achievable with the first `i` shipments and capacity `w`
