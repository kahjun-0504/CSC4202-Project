## **4.4 Algorithm Approach**

### **4.4.1 Algorithm Type**

The algorithm uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve the **0/1 Knapsack problem** optimally. This approach systematically evaluates all possible combinations of shipments by building up solutions to smaller subproblems, ensuring that the final selection of shipments **maximizes the total priority score** without exceeding the truckâ€™s weight capacity.

### **4.4.2 Why Dynamic Programming?**

**Dynamic Programming** is chosen because it **guarantees an optimal solution** by exhaustively considering every possible combination of shipments under the given weight constraint. This method is particularly suitable for the problem at hand, as it effectively handles the **trade-offs between multiple prioritization factors** such as revenue, urgency, and service level.

Additionally, Dynamic Programming remains **computationally efficient and practical** for moderate problem sizes, which aligns well with the **typical scale of daily truck loading operations** faced by DHL.
