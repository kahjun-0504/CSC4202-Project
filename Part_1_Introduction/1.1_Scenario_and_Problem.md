## 1.1 Scenario and Problem

DHL, a global leader in logistics and supply chain solutions, has transformed the cargo transport industry by combining advanced technology with decades of operational expertise. Operating in over 220 countries, DHL handles a wide spectrum of logistics services from express parcel delivery to large-scale freight movement across land, sea, and air. Its reputation for speed and reliability has made it a key logistics partner for e-commerce platforms, manufacturers, and multinational corporations.
Despite this global reach, DHL faces an increasingly critical operational issue: inefficient truck loading practices. With growing demand for faster and more cost-effective deliveries, the pressure on dispatch operations has intensified. Internal reviews have shown that trucks are often underloaded or inefficiently packed due to manual planning or rule-of-thumb methods. In many cases, dispatchers rely on experience rather than structured decision-making tools, which leads to inconsistencies in cargo prioritization and delivery performance.
For example, shipments containing high-priority or time-sensitive items may be delayed or underutilized if they are grouped with lower-priority goods in an inefficient manner. Such scenarios result in avoidable costs such as more delivery runs, increased fuel consumption, extended driver hours, and delayed shipments.
When scaled across hundreds of deliveries per day, these inefficiencies can significantly affect both operational costs and customer satisfaction. Delays, missed priorities, and partial shipments not only hurt DHLâ€™s performance metrics but also disrupt the operations of businesses depending on timely cargo arrivals.
