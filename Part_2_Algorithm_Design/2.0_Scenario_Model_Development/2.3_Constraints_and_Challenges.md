## 2.3 Constraints and Challenges
A key challenge in optimizing cargo loading lies in managing competing constraints, particularly weight and space, while maximizing shipment value. Although weight is often the primary constraint considered, overlooking cargo volume or dimensional fit can lead to suboptimal or even infeasible loading plans. For instance, high-value cargo may fall within the weight limit but exceed the spatial capacity of the delivery vehicle.

Another core difficulty lies in accurately quantifying shipment priority. The model incorporates multiple factors such as expected revenue, delivery urgency, and service level (e.g., premium vs. standard). However, determining the correct balance between these factors introduces subjective judgment. Misjudging the importance of one factor over another, such as overemphasizing urgency at the expense of overall revenue may reduce the total value delivered.

Moreover, shipments often vary widely in shape and packaging, which complicates space allocation. Even if the total volume appears acceptable, the geometry of individual items can make certain loading combinations impractical. This geometric constraint is especially significant for irregularly shaped cargo or items requiring upright placement, separation, or temperature control.

The algorithm also assumes accurate and consistent data on cargo attributes. In practice, missing or inaccurate data, such as an unrecorded delivery deadline or incorrect weight can undermine optimization efforts. In such cases, human oversight and exception handling may still be necessary.

Finally, the model focuses on what to load (i.e., cargo selection) rather than how to deliver (i.e., route planning). As a result, selected shipments may be optimal in value but suboptimal in terms of delivery sequence or routing efficiency. For example, a prioritized shipment might require a substantial detour, increasing delivery time or cost.

These constraints underscore the importance of a holistic approach to cargo optimization, one that balances quantitative modelling with operational realities and allows for flexibility when needed.
