## 1.3 Algorithm Suitability Review
To address DHL’s cargo loading inefficiencies, several algorithmic approaches are assessed based solely on their effectiveness in maximizing cargo value under a weight constraint. This constraint reflects the real-world operational limit where each truck can carry only up to a specific total weight, regardless of cargo volume or shape.

### Sorting
- Strengths:
  - Simple and fast to implement.
  - Enables quick ranking of items by value-to-weight ratio.
  - Useful as a preprocessing step to prioritize higher-efficiency cargo.

- Weaknesses:
  - Cannot guarantee optimal selection under strict weight limits.
  - Ignores combinations of items that may yield a better overall value.
  - Oversimplifies complex loading decisions by treating them as linear.

### Divide and Conquer (DAC)
- Strengths:
  - Breaks the problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., by route or shipment category).
  - Allows for partial optimization in segmented contexts.
  - Scales well for distributed cargo management systems.

- Weaknesses:
  - May not find globally optimal cargo sets unless carefully merged.
  - Not inherently designed to optimize cumulative cargo value.
  - Assumes independent subproblems, which may not align with a global weight limit.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Strengths:
  - Provides an optimal solution for weight-constrained cargo selection using the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.
  - Evaluates all viable combinations of cargo within the weight limit.
  - Well-suited for discrete cargo decisions (i.e., include or exclude each item).
  - Handles discrete cargo items effectively, determining optimal inclusion/exclusion decisions.

- Weaknesses:
  - Computationally intensive for large item sets.
  - Requires careful modeling of item weights and values.
  - May need optimization for real-time decision-making.

### Greedy Algorithms
- Strengths:
  - Very fast and easy to implement.
  - Prioritizes items with the best immediate value-to-weight ratio.
  - Useful for quick approximations or when time/resources are limited.

- Weaknesses:
  - Does not guarantee optimal cargo value.
  - Early selections may block higher-value combinations due to weight exhaustion.
  - Cannot revise earlier decisions, leading to suboptimal total loads.

### Graph Algorithms
- Strengths:
  - Can model complex dependencies or constraints, if any exist (e.g., loading order).
  - Useful for visualizing cargo groupings or routing with weight limits.

- Weaknesses:
  - Overly complex for simple weight-based value maximization.
  - Requires additional layers to perform optimization.
  - Not naturally suited to solving knapsack-type problems.

### Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack): The Optimized Choice
For DHL’s cargo loading optimization under a single weight constraint, Dynamic Programming using the 0/1 Knapsack Problem is the most effective approach. It allows:
- Maximization of total cargo value without exceeding the truck’s weight capacity.
- Evaluation of all feasible item combinations for the best outcome.
- Systematic, reproducible decision-making compared to manual or heuristic methods.

While other algorithms may be useful in specific contexts (e.g., sorting for preprocessing, greedy for speed), Dynamic Programming offers the rigor and reliability needed to optimize cargo value across DHL’s large-scale operations.
