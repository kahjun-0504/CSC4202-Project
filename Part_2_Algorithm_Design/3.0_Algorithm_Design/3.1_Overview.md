## 3.1 Overview
The optimized cargo loading algorithm consists of two main components:
- Determining the prioritization of cargo shipments based on their value
- Selecting the optimal combination of shipments to load within a fixed weight limit
The first component ranks shipments using a value-based prioritization approach. This value may reflect factors such as urgency, profitability, or delivery deadlines. The second component models the selection process as a 0/1 Knapsack Problem, where each shipment has a defined weight and value, and the total weight of selected shipments must not exceed the vehicle's maximum load capacity.

We represent this scenario as a bounded optimization problem:
- Each shipment is an item with a weight and a calculated value score.
- The truck has a predefined maximum weight capacity.
- The goal is to select a combination of shipments that maximizes total value while staying within the weight limit.

The algorithm evaluates all possible combinations of available shipments using a dynamic programming approach. Each shipment is characterized by a value and weight. The goal is to select a subset of shipments that maximizes total value without exceeding the truck’s maximum weight capacity.

The steps include:
- Assign a value and weight to each shipment.
- Construct a dynamic programming table to evaluate the maximum value achievable for each possible weight limit up to the truck’s capacity.
- Backtrack through the table to determine the set of shipments to load.

Key modeling elements include:
- **Item (Shipment):** Defined by its weight and value.
- **Constraint:** Maximum truck load weight (e.g., in kg or tonnes).
- **Optimization:** Maximize total shipment value without exceeding the weight limit.

This algorithm ensures high-value cargo is prioritized and fully utilizes available capacity for each shipment round. More complex considerations (e.g., shipment deadlines or client tiers) can be integrated into the value scoring formula, which will be detailed in Section 3.2.
