## 2.2 Cargo Value Prioritization
The process of determining which cargo to prioritize becomes essential when the available shipments exceed the truckâ€™s maximum weight capacity. For a single shipment, loading is straightforward. However, when there are multiple shipments with different characteristics, a structured method is needed to decide which cargo should be selected for delivery.

The prioritization is influenced by several key factors, including the value of the shipment, its urgency, and the level of service required. These factors guide the decision on which shipments offer the greatest overall benefit when space is limited.

Shipment value serves as the initial layer in our cargo prioritization strategy. High-value cargo is given preference to maximize the efficiency of each trip. This helps ensure that the truck carries shipments that contribute more significantly to business goals.

Urgency adds another dimension to the decision-making process. Shipments that are time-sensitive or near their delivery deadline may be prioritized higher, even if their value is lower. This ensures timely delivery and helps maintain service reliability.

Service level introduces a further layer of consideration. Premium service shipments may receive higher priority over standard ones to meet customer expectations and contractual obligations.

While these factors help shape the prioritization process, complexity arises when multiple shipments score similarly across value, urgency, or service level. In such cases, deciding which shipment to include becomes more challenging, especially under strict weight constraints.

To manage these complexities, a prioritization strategy is developed that balances all the key factors. This approach allows for a fair and efficient selection of cargo that meets both operational and customer-oriented goals.

The method for calculating and comparing shipment priority will be further explored in Section 3.2, where a cargo value model will be introduced to formalize this selection process.
