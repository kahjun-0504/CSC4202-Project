## 6.2 Time Complexity Analysis 

This program uses dynamic programming to optimize the selection of shipments based on a calculated priority score. The overall time complexity includes several parts, which are analyzed below:

**1. Priority Score Calculation**
```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Compute priority score
}
```

This loop runs once for each of the n shipments. Each calculation involves basic arithmetic operations, which take constant time. Therefore, the time complexity for this part is O(n).

**2. Dynamic Programming Table Construction**
```
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
        // Fill DP table using recurrence
    }
}
```
This nested loop iterates over all shipments (n) and all possible weight values up to the truck's capacity (W). Each cell in the table is filled using a constant-time operation. Thus, the time complexity for filling the table is O(n × W).

**3. Backtracking to Find Selected Shipments**
```
for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    if (dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]) {
        // Track selected shipments
    }
}
```
This loop runs up to n times, once for each shipment, to trace back which shipments were selected. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).

**4. Output of Selected Shipments**
```
for (Shipment s : selected) {
    // Print details
}
```
This loop prints all selected shipments. In the worst case, all n shipments could be selected. So, the time complexity is O(n).

When we combining all parts:
- Priority score calculation: O(n)
- DP table filling: O(n × W)
- Backtracking: O(n)
- Output: O(n)

Thus, the total time complexity is:

O(n W +n) = O(n W)  

Since O(n × W) dominates O(n ), the overall time complexity is O(n × W).
