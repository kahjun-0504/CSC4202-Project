The following is the full content of the sample_shipments.csv file used in the demonstration. This file is in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format, where each line represents one shipment record and each value is separated by a comma. The fields are ordered as follows:

**Shipment ID, Revenue, Time Remaining, Service Level, Weight**

![dataset 1](../images/dataset1.png)
