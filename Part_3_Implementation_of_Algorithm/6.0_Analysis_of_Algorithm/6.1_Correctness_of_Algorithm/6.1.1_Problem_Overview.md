## 6.1 Correctness of Algorithm

Tracing the output of each possible input is impractical for large inputs. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm using a formal method. For this algorithm, we use the loop invariant technique to prove the correctness of our dynamic programming approach to solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem.

### 6.1.1 Problem Overview

In the **0/1 Knapsack problem**, we aim to choose a subset of items (in this case, **shipments**) with given weights and values (**priority scores**), to maximize the total value without exceeding a **weight capacity limit** (W = 500).

We use a **bottom-up dynamic programming (DP)** approach to fill a 2D array `dp[i][w]`, where:

- `i` is the number of shipments considered so far  
- `w` is the current weight capacity  
- `dp[i][w]` holds the maximum priority score achievable with the first `i` shipments and capacity `w`

### 6.1.2 Loop Invariant for Dynamic Programming Table

**Invariant Condition:**  
At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, `dp[i][w]` correctly stores the maximum total priority score that can be obtained using the first `i` shipments and with a knapsack capacity of exactly `w`.

**Initialization:**  
Before the loops begin, the entire `dp` table is initialized to `0`. This correctly represents the base case:
- If we use 0 items (`i = 0`), the best total score is `0` for all capacities.
- If the knapsack has 0 capacity (`w = 0`), no items can be included, and thus the total score is also `0`.

This base case satisfies the loop invariant.

**Maintenance:**  
In each iteration of the nested loop:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
```
We check whether the current item (`i - 1`) can be included (`weight[i - 1] <= w`):

- **Include case**: If the item fits, we consider the score if it is included:  
  `include = priorityScore[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weight[i - 1]]`

- **Exclude case**: If the item is not included, we use:  
  `dp[i - 1][w]`

The larger of these two values is stored in `dp[i][w]`, which maintains the invariant that `dp[i][w]` holds the best total score achievable for the first `i` items and weight `w`.

---

### Termination

When the loops complete, `dp[n][W]` contains the **maximum score achievable** using all `n` shipments within the weight limit `W`.

Additionally, the `keep` matrix stores the decisions made, which are then backtracked to reconstruct the **optimal selection of shipments**.

Thus, the final output derived from `dp` and `keep` reflects the correct and optimal subset of shipments based on the knapsack constraints.

---

### 6.1.3 Conclusion

Using the concept of **loop invariants**, we have shown that:

- The algorithm correctly initializes base cases  
- Maintains correctness at each step of the iteration  
- And provides the correct solution upon termination  

Hence, the **0/1 Knapsack implementation is correct** and consistently computes the optimal selection of shipments based on their computed priority scores.
