## **4.3 Mathematical Model**

### **4.3.1 Priority Score Calculation**

For each shipment, a **priority score** is calculated using the formula:

priority_scoreᵢ = α ⋅ revenueᵢ + β ⋅ (1 / time_remaining_in_daysᵢ) + γ ⋅ service_levelᵢ


Where:

- **α = 0.5** (importance of revenue)  
- **β = 0.3** (importance of urgency)  
- **γ = 0.7** (importance of service level)

> **Important:** The final result of the priority score is **rounded to the nearest whole number**.

### **4.3.2 Optimization Objective**

The goal of the algorithm is to **select a combination of shipments** that yields the **maximum total priority score**, while ensuring the **total weight** of the selected shipments **does not exceed the truck's maximum capacity**.

Formally, we aim to:

maximize ∑ (priority_scoreᵢ × xᵢ) for i = 1 to n


**Subject to:**

∑ (weightᵢ × xᵢ) ≤ W for i = 1 to n


Where:

- **xᵢ ∈ {0,1}** is a binary decision variable:
  - `xᵢ = 1` if shipment *i* is selected  
  - `xᵢ = 0` if shipment *i* is not selected
- **priority_scoreᵢ** is the pre-computed score reflecting the combined importance of revenue, urgency, and service level.
- **weightᵢ** is the weight of shipment *i*.
- **W** is the truck's **maximum weight capacity**.

---

### **Explanation**

- The **objective function** sums the priority scores of all selected shipments.
- The **constraint** ensures the combined weight does not exceed the truck's load limit.
- The **binary nature** of `xᵢ` reflects that each shipment is either **fully included** or **excluded** — making this a **0/1 Knapsack problem**.

This formulation allows the algorithm to make an **optimal trade-off** between revenue, urgency, and service level, **automatically balancing business objectives** based on the weighted scoring formula.
