## 6.1 Correctness of Algorithm
Tracing the output of each possible input is impractical for large inputs. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm using a formal method. For this algorithm, we use the loop invariant technique to prove the correctness of our dynamic programming approach to solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
