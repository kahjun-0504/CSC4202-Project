## **3.3 Example**

To demonstrate the cargo loading optimization algorithm in action, consider the following real-world scenario faced by DHL:

A DHL distribution hub receives five shipment orders simultaneously. Each shipment has a different revenue, time remaining before the delivery deadline, and service level. The truck assigned to the deliveries has a **maximum weight capacity of 30 kg**. The challenge is to determine which shipments to load in order to **maximize the total priority score without exceeding the weight limit**.

### **Step 1: Shipment Data and Priority Score Calculation**

#### **Table 1: Shipment Information**

| Shipment ID | Weight (kg) | Revenue (RM) | Time Remaining (Days) | Service Level |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|
| A           | 10          | 200          | 1                      | Premium        |
| B           | 8           | 180          | 3                      | Standard       |
| C           | 5           | 120          | 2                      | Premium        |
| D           | 12          | 220          | 4                      | Standard       |
| E           | 7           | 150          | 1                      | Standard       |

Each shipment is evaluated using the **priority score formula**:

priority_score = Î± â‹… revenue + Î² â‹… (1 / time_remaining_in_days) + Î³ â‹… service_level


Where:

- **Î± = 0.5** (importance of revenue)  
- **Î² = 0.3** (importance of urgency)  
- **Î³ = 0.7** (importance of premium service)  
- **Service Level = 10** for Premium, **0** for Standard

#### **Table 2: Calculated Priority Scores**

| Shipment ID | Revenue | 1 / Days | Service Level | Priority Score Calculation                      | Final Score |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| A           | 200     | 1.000    | 10             | 0.5Ã—200 + 0.3Ã—1 + 0.7Ã—10 = 100 + 0.3 + 7        | â‰ˆ **107**   |
| B           | 180     | 0.333    | 0              | 0.5Ã—180 + 0.3Ã—0.333 + 0 = 90 + 0.1              | â‰ˆ **90**    |
| C           | 120     | 0.5      | 10             | 0.5Ã—120 + 0.3Ã—0.5 + 0.7Ã—10 = 60 + 0.15 + 7      | â‰ˆ **67**    |
| D           | 220     | 0.25     | 0              | 0.5Ã—220 + 0.3Ã—0.25 + 0 = 110 + 0.075            | â‰ˆ **110**   |
| E           | 150     | 1.000    | 0              | 0.5Ã—150 + 0.3Ã—1 + 0 = 75 + 0.3                  | â‰ˆ **75**    |

### **Step 2: Apply 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm**

The goal is to select shipments that **maximize total priority score** without exceeding the **30 kg** weight limit.

The problem is modeled using the **0/1 Knapsack dynamic programming approach**.

> ðŸ§  *A simplified version of the DP matrix is shown below (full implementation is handled in code).*

### **Step 3: Extracting the Optimal Shipment Set**

From Table 2, the maximum total priority score achievable within the 30 kg weight constraint is 339.85. To identify the selected shipments, we backtrack through the table:

339 - 75(index 5â€™s priority score) = 264

264 â€“ 67 (index 3â€™s priority score) = 197

197 - 90 (index 2â€™s priority score) = 107

107 - 107 (index 1â€™s priority score) = 0

From the above calculation we can confirm that the optimal choice will be Shipments A, B, C and E (index 1, 2, 3 and 5), giving a total weight of 30kg (within the weight limit) and yielding the maximum priority score of 339.

### **Step 4: Final Shipment Selection**

#### **Table 4: Final Shipment Selection Based on Optimization**

| Shipment ID | Weight (kg) | Priority Score |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| A           | 10           | 107            |
| B           | 8            | 90             |
| C           | 5            | 67             |
| E           | 7            | 75             |
| **Total**   | **30**       | **339**        |

---

The selected shipments in **Table 4** will be loaded for the next delivery. This combination balances **profitability**, **delivery urgency**, and **premium service considerations**, making the most efficient use of the truck's capacity under current business constraints.
