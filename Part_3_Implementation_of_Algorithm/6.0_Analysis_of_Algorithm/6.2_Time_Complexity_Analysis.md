## 6.2 Time Complexity Analysis 

This program uses dynamic programming to optimize the selection of shipments based on a calculated priority score. The overall time complexity includes several parts, which are analyzed below:

**1. Priority Score Calculation**
```
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Compute priority score
}
```

This loop runs once for each of the n shipments. Each calculation involves basic arithmetic operations, which take constant time. Therefore, the time complexity for this part is O(n).

**2. Dynamic Programming Table Construction**
```
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
        // Fill DP table using recurrence
    }
}
```
This nested loop iterates over all shipments (n) and all possible weight values up to the truck's capacity (W). Each cell in the table is filled using a constant-time operation. Thus, the time complexity for filling the table is O(n × W).

**3. Backtracking to Find Selected Shipments**
```
for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    if (dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]) {
        // Track selected shipments
    }
}
```
This loop runs up to n times, once for each shipment, to trace back which shipments were selected. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).

**4. Output of Selected Shipments**
```
for (Shipment s : selected) {
    // Print details
}
```
This loop prints all selected shipments. In the worst case, all n shipments could be selected. So, the time complexity is O(n).

When we combining all parts:
- Priority score calculation: O(n)
- DP table filling: O(n × W)
- Backtracking: O(n)
- Output: O(n)

Thus, the total time complexity is:

O(n W +n) = O(n W)  

Since O(n × W) dominates O(n ), the overall time complexity is O(n × W).


## Best Case Scenario

The time complexity is O(nW). This is because the dynamic programming method always fills the entire table, without skipping any part of the computation. For example, even if all shipments are too heavy and none can be added to the truck, the program still processes each cell in the DP table. The algorithm does not include any shortcuts or early exits, so it performs the same number of steps no matter how simple the input might be. Therefore, the best case still requires filling out the entire table.

## Average Case Scenario

In the average case, where some shipments are selected and others are not, the algorithm still processes all n × W table entries. The actual results in the table may vary based on shipment weights and scores, but the number of operations stays the same. Since each shipment and weight value combination is considered, the time complexity remains O(nW) on average. The approach does not adjust the number of steps based on the input data, so the average-case performance is the same as in the best and worst cases.

## Worst Case Scenario

In the worst-case scenario, the program processes every shipment and every possible truck weight from 0 to W. It fills a dynamic programming (DP) table of size (n + 1) × (W + 1), where n is the number of shipments and W is the truck’s maximum weight capacity. For each entry in this table, the program checks whether including a shipment will improve the total priority score. This means it performs a constant-time operation for each cell in the table. As a result, the total number of operations in the worst case is proportional to n × W, giving a time complexity of O(nW). This case happens regardless of how the shipment data is arranged, and it ensures that no possible option is missed.

One possible improvement to the current algorithm is to use a Greedy approach instead of dynamic programming. By selecting shipments based on their priority score per unit weight, the algorithm can sort the shipments and pick the most valuable ones first until the weight limit is reached. This reduces the time complexity from O(n × W) to O(n log n) due to sorting, followed by a single pass through the sorted list. 

However, we did not implement this method in our program, as the Greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. Our current use of dynamic programming, although slower, ensures we get the best possible combination of shipments. Given that our dataset is relatively small and manageable, the trade-off for optimality is acceptable.
