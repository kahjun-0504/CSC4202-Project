## **4.6 Correctness Justification**

Briefly explain the correctness of Dynamic Programming by analysing the result.

---

## **4.7 Complexity Analysis**

Analyze the worst-case, best-case, and average-case time complexity of the algorithm to evaluate its efficiency and scalability.

---

## **4.8 Assumptions and Limitations**

- The **truck capacity constraint is weight-based only** (volume is not modeled).
- Shipment data (`revenue`, `urgency`, `service level`, `weight`) is assumed to be **accurate and complete**.
- **Time remaining (`time_remainingáµ¢`) must be greater than zero**.
- The algorithm **does not handle routing or delivery sequencing** after selection â€” it focuses solely on **cargo selection**.

---

## **4.9 Implementation of Algorithm**

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- Shipment data is provided as a **list or array** containing:
  - Weights
  - Revenues
  - Urgency
  - Service levels

- DP table is initialized and filled according to the recurrence relation.
- Backtracking function retrieves the optimal shipment set.
---

## **4.10 Program Testing**

The implementation is validated using several test cases, including:

- âœ… Example scenario from **Section 3.3**  
- âœ… Edge cases:
  - All shipments fit within truck capacity
  - Only a subset of shipments fit
  - No shipment fits the truck capacity

Each scenario is checked for:
- **Correct shipment selection**
- **Accurate total priority score**
- **Total weight compliance**
